                    Time management is the most important aspect of exam preparation. More often than not, many students look at time as their enemy because they start preparing a little too late in a haphazard manner, which causes too much confusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Without proper time management tips, studying will not benefit you much because you wonâ€™t be able to organize your syllabus in sync with the amount of time you have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This will lead to a lot of stress and anxiety, which will eventually affect your performance in the exam.
